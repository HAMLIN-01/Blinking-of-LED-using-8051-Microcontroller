# Blinking-of-LED-using-8051-Microcontroller
This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using the 8051 microcontroller, programmed in embedded C.
# Description
This project demonstrates the basic functionality of an 8051 microcontroller by implementing a simple LED blinking program. The LED is connected to one of the microcontroller's GPIO pins, and it toggles ON and OFF at regular intervals. The project is written in Embedded C and simulates the behavior of the LED using Proteus.
The main goal of this project is to understand the process of setting up the 8051 microcontroller, writing the necessary code to control its I/O pins, and using simulation tools to verify the functionality. This basic example is a foundational step toward more complex embedded system designs.
# Features:
Microcontroller Used: 8051 (AT89C51 or equivalent)
Language: Embedded C
Simulation Software: Proteus
# How it Works:
The LED is connected to a GPIO pin of the 8051 (typically P2.0).
The microcontroller toggles the state of the GPIO pin, turning the LED ON and OFF.
A delay function is used to control the blinking rate.
# Simulation:
The project is simulated in Proteus, where the circuit consisting of the 8051, LED, and other components is visually represented, allowing for testing without physical hardware.
